[INFO] org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-clean-plugin:3.2.0

Name: Apache Maven Clean Plugin
Description: The Maven Clean Plugin is a plugin that removes files generated
  at build-time in a project's directory.
Group Id: org.apache.maven.plugins
Artifact Id: maven-clean-plugin
Version: 3.2.0
Goal Prefix: clean

This plugin has 2 goals:

clean:clean
  Description: Goal which cleans the build.
    This attempts to clean a project's working directory of the files that were
    generated at build-time. By default, it discovers and deletes the
    directories configured in project.build.directory,
    project.build.outputDirectory, project.build.testOutputDirectory, and
    project.reporting.outputDirectory.
    
    Files outside the default may also be included in the deletion by
    configuring the filesets tag.
  Implementation: org.apache.maven.plugins.clean.CleanMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    excludeDefaultDirectories (Default: false)
      User property: maven.clean.excludeDefaultDirectories
      Disables the deletion of the default output directories configured for a
      project. If set to true, only the files/directories selected via the
      parameter filesets will be deleted.
      Starting with 3.0.0 the property has been renamed from
      clean.excludeDefaultDirectories to maven.clean.excludeDefaultDirectories.

    failOnError (Default: true)
      User property: maven.clean.failOnError
      Indicates whether the build will continue even if there are clean errors.

    fast (Default: false)
      User property: maven.clean.fast
      Enables fast clean if possible. If set to true, when the plugin is
      executed, a directory to be deleted will be atomically moved inside the
      maven.clean.fastDir directory and a thread will be launched to delete the
      needed files in the background. When the build is completed, maven will
      wait until all the files have been deleted. If any problem occurs during
      the atomic move of the directories, the plugin will default to the
      traditional deletion mechanism.

    fastDir
      User property: maven.clean.fastDir
      When fast clean is specified, the fastDir property will be used as the
      location where directories to be deleted will be moved prior to
      background deletion. If not specified, the
      ${maven.multiModuleProjectDirectory}/target/.clean directory will be
      used. If the ${build.directory} has been modified, you'll have to adjust
      this property explicitly. In order for fast clean to work correctly, this
      directory and the various directories that will be deleted should usually
      reside on the same volume. The exact conditions are system dependant
      though, but if an atomic move is not supported, the standard deletion
      mechanism will be used.

    fastMode (Default: background)
      User property: maven.clean.fastMode
      Mode to use when using fast clean. Values are: background to start
      deletion immediately and waiting for all files to be deleted when the
      session ends, at-end to indicate that the actual deletion should be
      performed synchronously when the session ends, or defer to specify that
      the actual file deletion should be started in the background when the
      session ends (this should only be used when maven is embedded in a long
      running process).

    filesets
      The list of file sets to delete, in addition to the default directories.
      For example:
      <filesets>
       <fileset>
       <directory>src/main/generated</directory>
       <followSymlinks>false</followSymlinks>
       <useDefaultExcludes>true</useDefaultExcludes>
       <includes>
       <include>*.java</include>
       </includes>
       <excludes>
       <exclude>Template*</exclude>
       </excludes>
       </fileset>
      </filesets>

    followSymLinks (Default: false)
      User property: maven.clean.followSymLinks
      Sets whether the plugin should follow symbolic links while deleting files
      from the default output directories of the project. Not following
      symlinks requires more IO operations and heap memory, regardless whether
      symlinks are actually present. So projects with a huge output directory
      that knowingly does not contain symlinks can improve performance by
      setting this parameter to true.
      Starting with 3.0.0 the property has been renamed from
      clean.followSymLinks to maven.clean.followSymLinks.

    retryOnError (Default: true)
      User property: maven.clean.retryOnError
      Indicates whether the plugin should undertake additional attempts (after
      a short delay) to delete a file if the first attempt failed. This is
      meant to help deleting files that are temporarily locked by third-party
      tools like virus scanners or search indexing.

    skip (Default: false)
      User property: maven.clean.skip
      Disables the plugin execution.
      Starting with 3.0.0 the property has been renamed from clean.skip to
      maven.clean.skip.

    verbose
      User property: maven.clean.verbose
      Sets whether the plugin runs in verbose mode. As of plugin version 2.3,
      the default value is derived from Maven's global debug flag (compare
      command line switch -X).
      Starting with 3.0.0 the property has been renamed from clean.verbose to
      maven.clean.verbose.

clean:help
  Description: Display help information on maven-clean-plugin.
    Call mvn clean:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name> to display parameter
    details.
  Implementation: org.apache.maven.plugins.clean.HelpMojo
  Language: java

  Available parameters:

    detail (Default: false)
      User property: detail
      If true, display all settable properties for each goal.

    goal
      User property: goal
      The name of the goal for which to show help. If unspecified, all goals
      will be displayed.

    indentSize (Default: 2)
      User property: indentSize
      The number of spaces per indentation level, should be positive.

    lineLength (Default: 80)
      User property: lineLength
      The maximum length of a display line, should be positive.
